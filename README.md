An Accessible Split 65% Mechanical Keyboard. Easily 3D printable and assembled with common magnets. Uses leaf-spring o-ring bottom mount. Works with the [Quefrency PCB](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-rev-5-pcbs-hotswap-65-65xt-split-staggered-keyboard) from keebio.

### Hardware and Production Notes

Here's the list of hardware parts (I've provided some sources, but these parts are generic). All parts can be sourced from keebio or amazon.
- [Bar Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B6VNMJP7)
- [Dot Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SKHYGLN)
- [Rubber Dots](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCNM69B)
- [O Rings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YJWT9W7)
- [Quefrency PCB](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-rev-5-pcbs-hotswap-65-65xt-split-staggered-keyboard)
- Superglue (for permanently attaching magnets)
- EC11 Knob
- USB C to C cable
- Stabilizers
- Switches

I have provided .step files, which are industry standard for mechanical design. As long as you give credit back to me, I encourage you to modify, copy, and incorporate my files into your own designs. Many 3D printing softwares such as BambuStudio accept .step files, but if yours does not, there are an abundance of .step > .stl converters online.

### 3D Printing Information
The 3D printing process is pretty easy and the project should be able to be printed in anywhere from 3-6 separate prints, which all in all should take no longer than 2 days. I used a BambuLabs P1P and PLA with 0.1mm layer height. Be careful of the pins to hold the switchplate, as they are fragile. You may need to adjust their diameter depending on your 3D printer.
