- Superglue (for permanently attaching magnets)
- EC11 Knob
- USB C to C cable
- Stabilizers

### 3D Printing Information
The 3D printing process is pretty easy and the project should be able to be printed in anywhere from 3-6 separate prints, which all in all should take no longer than 2 days. I used a BambuLabs P1P and PLA with 0.1mm layer height. Be careful of the pins to hold the switchplate, as they are fragile. You may need to adjust their diameter depending on your 3D printer.
